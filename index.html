<h2>About</h2>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ramblinwreck.com/sports/m-footbl/geot-m-footbl-body.html">Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets</a> started out as a couple of guys that called themsleves the Blacksmiths. In 1892, they played their first game versus Mercer University and lost 12-6. The mascot of Georgia Tech was first known as the Engineers. Georgia Tech's first ever win was versus the University of Georgia, where they defeated them 28-6 for their first victory. Georgia fans got mad and threw rocks at the Tech players, which is why they are now rivales. The Heisman Trophy, which goes to what the media thinks to be the best player of the year, was named after John Heisman, a coach at Georgia Tech in 1903.</p>

They have a very tough schedule having to play Notre Dame, Clemson, Florida State, Virginia Tech, Miami, and their rivale Georgia.

<h2>News</h2>

<h3>Injury picture better for Georgia Tech</h3>
<img class="align-left" src="img/taquon_marshall.png" alt="TaQuon Marshall">
<p>During the first 4 games Georgia Tech has played, they had serveral crucial injuries, losing members on both offense and defense. The players they lost are Rod Rook-Chungong, Marcus Allen, Trey Braun, TaQuon Marshall, and Patrick Gamble. Mostly all of those guys are starters on the team, so those were some bad losses, but they are set to play this Saturday versus North Carolina. The players that will be returning are all of the ones listed except Patrick Gamble, one of Tech's good offensive lineman.</p>

<h3>Justin Thomas trying 'too much' in effort to move Georgia Tech offense</h3>
<img class="align-right" src="img/justin_thomas.png" alt="Justin Thomas">
<p>Georgia Tech quaterback Justin Thomas, a very talented athlete, has done some things in the first 4 games of the season he needs to improve. Against the Duke Blue Devils he only completed 6 out 21 passes, and only rushed for 2.4 yards per carry. That is the 4th lowest rushing yards per carry in a game coach Paul Johnson has ever had. Instead of relaxing while playing, Paul Johnson felt like Justin Thomas was trying to do too much to gain yards for the offense, which often lead to loss of yards. Thomas has acknowledged that he made mistakes, and said he would trust his teammates more in upcoming games.</p>
